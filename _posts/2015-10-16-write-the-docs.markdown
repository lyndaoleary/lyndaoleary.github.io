Today, I created the Write The Docs Ireland meetup. Check out the [meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Write-The-Docs-Ireland/).

# What is Write The Docs?

Write the Docs is a series of conferences and local meetups focused on documentation systems, tech writing theory, and information delivery.
For more information, see: [Write the Docs](http://www.writethedocs.org/)

# Who should come along to the meetup?

People who care about making the reader experience awesome by delivering excellent documentation. We encourage writers, developers, designers, learning professionals, and documentation enthusiasts. Come to our meetup and strategize how to make documentation great, share ideas, and meet fellow people who care about documentation in Ireland.
