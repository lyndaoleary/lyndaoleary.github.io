Today, I set up the Women in Technology Galway meetup. Over the last year, I met some interesting ladies who work in the IT industry. It was great to meet motivated women who wanted to share their experience. I noticed there wasn't a women in tech meetup in Galway and took the opportunity to create the meetup.
I am hoping the Women in Technology Galway meetup will provide a platform for women to learn, network, and communicate with each other. Check out the new meetup page: [Women in Technology Galway meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Women-In-Technology-Galway/)


**Women in Technology Galway meetup**


Aim: To give us an opportunity to mingle and meet with other female professionals working in the IT industry. If you are interested in pursing a career in IT, learning about new technologies, contributing to open source, or getting involved in technical workshops, then join this group and find support within the community.

Let's build a strong innovative community lead by women in Galway :)
