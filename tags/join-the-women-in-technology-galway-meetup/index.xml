      <description>Technology plays an influential part in our lives. Technology is always changing and growing. We need to raise awareness of women in tech and make women more visible in the IT industry. The Women in Technology Galwaymeetup group provides a platform for communication and discussion for students and professionals in Galway.
If you are interested in hearing about the perks of working in IT, learning about the latest technologies or networking with other professionals, then come along to the Women in Technology Galway meetup.</description>
