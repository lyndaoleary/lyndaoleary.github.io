## WITS Galway Launch (April 27th)

On the 27th April, the WITS Galway group was launched.  The event took place at the Blackstone LaunchPad NUIG. 
Women In Technology Science (WITS) is an independent, voluntary organization set up in 1990 to actively promote and support women in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM).

Mary Carroll was the main speaker at the event. Mary is the Vice-Chair of WITS and is a business strategist with over 25 years experience in design engineering, management consulting and business development. Mary gave an overview of WITS and followed with the Unconscious Bias workshop. The Unconscious Bias workshop covered:

* What is unconscious bias?
* Examples of unconscious bias in the workplace
* Effects of unconscious bias
* Addressing unconscious bias

The informative workshop sparked interesting questions and a diverse conversation between the participants.

*Thank you* to everyone who joined us on the night and a special thanks to *Annie* and *Tracy* from Workbench Galway for setting up the space and refreshments. *BOI Workbench Galway* was the perfect space to hold our meetup and I really appreciate the support from them. The facility is an excellent space for budding entrepreneurs, new businesses, and community events.

Last Thursday, the first *Women in Technology Galway* meetup was held in BOI Workbench Galway. The cold, frosty weather did not hinder participation on the night. Attendees had the opportunity to mingle and enjoy a buffet style selection of scones and sandwiches while sipping tea and coffee.

To kick start the event, I gave an overview of the meetup group. For those who missed the meetup, you can view the [meetup slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19uYiomGfPR1zpx7ExR7zFBstQ3NhkBgUYC1aSoh9hAA/edit?usp=sharing) or view our [top tips](https://t.co/LASWa4Esl1).

On the speaker panel, I had the pleasure of chatting with *Kim Tighe* and *Patricia Hegarty*. Kim Tighe works as a Solution Lead at Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Patricia Hegarty works as a QA Engineer at Fidelity Investments. Both Kim and Patricia are motivated professional women and have experience and expertise in the IT sector.

I acted as moderator and prepared a list of questions for Kim and Patricia. We covered topics such as role models, career advice, work and life balance, essential skills, and 2016 resolutions.


After the speaker panel, the questions flowed. The meetup drew to a close with attendees using the final moments to network.

All in all, it was a fantastic meetup. We left the building motivated and energized. Empowered from our discussions and the ladies we met.
